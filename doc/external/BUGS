JALv2 BUGS
----------

The following is the list of open bugs as of this release. When reporting
a bug, please try to give as much detail as possible. It is best if
you can send me an archive file (zip or tar) that contains the suspect
code and any supporting libraries. The faster I can reproduce the bug,
the faster it can be fixed. Anything sent to me will remain confidential!

* FOR with a negative controlling expression gives unexpected results

* placing a non-bit variable at a bit-offset does not work

* __config has been deprecated, the compiler should fix this.

* Under some circumstances variable allocation can take hours
  Workaround: use the `-no-variable-reuse' compiler option

* Occasionally the hardware stack computation is off

* The compiler leaks memory like a sieve. This will never affect the
  end user, but bothers me greatly.

* operand size mismatch not always reported

* bugreport_20100405 -- print_string_terminator optimized away if 0
* bugreport_20100407
* bugreport_20100502
* bugreport_20100523
