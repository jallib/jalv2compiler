JALv2 Feature Requests
----------------------

If you have a suggestion or request, let me know. The compiler is
continuing to evolve and you, the users, know best what need to be done
to improve it. Please keep in mind that any changes to the compiler *must*
be backward compatible, thus not breaking any existing code.

* Add lines for gpsim

* The code that prints the source line for the assembly statements
  should be a bit smarter.

* ISR context saves should only occur when the object is used in both
  USER and ISR contexts. Currently the context is saved whenever it is
  used in the ISR.

* 16 bit cores should be able to use both interrupt levels

* Pascal style records

* Arrays should be promoted to first-class objects allowing them to be
  directly passed to functions (as in, print_string("hello world\n"))

* Pseudo-variables should be array compatible

* Variables should be placeable into EEPROM

* Hybrid chip support (XLP PICS 12/16F18/19xx)

* Auto allocate out of pseudo-variable area

* Pointers
