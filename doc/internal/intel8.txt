I've not found it documented, but this appears to be Intel hex-8
format:

:     -- start of line
ll    -- line length in bytes 
bb bb -- data *byte* offset in MSB/LSB (since the PIC uses 14 bit
         instructions, this is the program counter * 2)
00    -- constant 0
data  -- data (LSB/MSB)
chk   -- negative checksum of all data on the line (including the header)

first line : 02 00 00 04 00 00 fa
last line  : 00 00 00 01 ff

It looks like an attempt is made to keep things aligned on 16 byte boundaries.
