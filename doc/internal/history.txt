17 March 2004 -- first release (0.90)

xx March 2004 -- second release (0.91) including:
                   support the ``include'' keyword
                   support the new ``pragma'' keyword
                   change to the variable definition to allow one
                     specify in which banks a variable is mirrored
                   moving the PIC initialization code to include files
                   providing include files for the following:
                     pic16f873/4/6/7
                     pic16f818/9
                   modify the parser to emit a ``...not available''
                     error for commands not supported on some PICs
                     (as opposed to a very obtuse variable not found
                   added commands:
                     INTERRUPT_PORTB enable, pullup
                     IR_PORTB_BEGIN...IR_PORTB_END
                     IR_USER_BEGIN...IR_USER_END
                   added common warning (things that keep happening to me):
                     ''interrupts never enabled''
                     ''timer never configured
                     ''timer never started''
                     ''usart rx never configured''
                     ''usart tx never configured''
                     ''adc never configured''
                     ''adc never started''
                   fixed 2 bugs in ISR generation  

April 2004   -- third release (0.92) including:
                  fixed include files
                  fixed optimizer bug where registers were being set with 
                    partial results
                  fixed lookup table creation at page boundary  
                  fixed variable bank selection optimizer code
                  fixed cross-bank add code (adding two variables in different
                    banks
July 2004    -- fourth release (0.93) including:
                  fixed a problem where a forward reference to a function
                    wouldn't mark the variable correctly so some code using
                    the variable would not be generated
                  fixed a problem with the decrement operation  
                  Added commands:
                      EEPROM_READ  : read a value from the on-chip EEPROM
                      EEPROM_WRITE : write a value to the on-chip EEPROM
                      EEPROM_WAIT  : wait for the last write to complete
