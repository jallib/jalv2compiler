Some history
============
The original documentation was created by Kyle York in docbook format from which a version
was provided in text format.

The text format was later imported in MS Word and formatted by Rob Jansen. From there pdf versions
where created. Some additions where made to this version of the compiler documentation.

In order to be able to easily create documentaion in pdf and html format a conversion was needed
as to be able to use dita for publishing this documetnation. The MS Word files where imported using 
the XML Editor XML Mind and all documentation was reformatted by Rob Jansen.

Creating pdf and html documentation using Dita
==============================================
Dita version 3.7.2 was used for this.

A Makefile is available for creating a pdf and html version.

Make all creates both version.
