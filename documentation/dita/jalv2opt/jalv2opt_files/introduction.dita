These options are all described here.</p><p>See the JALv2 documentation for definitions and conventions.  Any time multiple options are allowed, the default option is preceded with a '*'. An {empty} option is interpreted as the default option.</p><p>All available compiler options can be seen by passing the single options "--help" to the compiler.
