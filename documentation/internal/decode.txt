Decoding the assembly file:
---------------------------

When compiling with the debug flag, the assembly file contains a lot of 
extra information useful for debugging the internal state and HEX file
output. After each assembly line output is a comment, starting on column
61, which looks like this:

;## OV rs rs [hl hl] pppp hhhh

This is decoded as follows:

##: deepest stack depth when this instruction is executed. 15 is considered
    infinite

O : Optimization flag; '-' if the optimizer shouldn't touch this
V : Visited flag; the analyzer has determined that this instruction
    can be visited in at least one path

r : The state of status:rp1 before this instruction is executed.
    'r' = clear, 'R' = set
s : The state of status:rp0 before this instruction is executed.
    's' = clear, 'S' = set

h : The state of pclath<4> before this instruction is executed
    'h' = clear, 'H' = set
l : The state of pclath<3> before this instruction is executed
    'l' = clear, 'L' = set

h : The state of pclath<4> after this instruction is executed
l : The state of pclath<3> after this instruction is executed

pppp : the program counter for this instruction
hhhh : the byte code created for this instruction. Note that the order
       is byte reversed in the HEX file.
