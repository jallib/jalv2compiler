# Welcome to the JALV2 Compiler 

This project holds the source files and executables of the JALV2 compiler.

JALV2 is a high level language designed to hide the general nuisance of programming a MicroChip PIC
processor. The language is loosely based on Pascal. The compiler is available for Window and Linux
both as 32-bit or 64-bit executable. 

In order to build and compile your program for your PIC, you need to include a device file for
your specific PIC into your program. These device files can be found in the jallib repository:
https://github.com/jallib/jallib/tree/master/include/device
 
Check the README file for more information.

Have fun !
