# Welcome to the JALV2 Compiler 

This project holds the source files and executables of the JALV2 compiler.

JALV2 is a high level language designed to hide the general nuisance of programming a MicroChip PIC
processor. The language is loosely based on Pascal. The compiler is available for Window and Linux
both as 32-bit or 64-bit executable. 

In order to build and compile your program for your PIC, you need to include device files and
some other files for your specific PIC into your program. These device files can be found in
the jallib repository: https://github.com/jallib/jallib/tree/master/

Examples can be found in the src/test directory of this repository.
 
Check the README file for more information.

Have fun !
